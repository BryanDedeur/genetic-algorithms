# AS2 - 5 Dejong functions

## Getting Started

This project uses cmake to create a independent build environment so source code is not disturbed.

[See cmake installation here](https://cmake.org/install/)

Start by building in a build directory.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Then compile in the build directory.
```
make
```

Then run executable.
```
./ga
```
